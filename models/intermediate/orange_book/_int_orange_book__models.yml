      This is an attempt at an NDC-level mapping of Orange Book TE codes. There are cases in Orange Book where two different strengths of a given ANDA have different TE codes. This means within an ANDA, two different NDCs could have different TE codes.

      The problem we're encountering is that there's not a reliable / programmatic way to get from the strength of a product in Orange Book and the strength of the product in the FDA NDC Directory.

      Because I can't figure out NDC-level mapping, I only include applications with a single OB TE code.

      Again - please only treat this as the beginning of a proof of concept and do not use for clinical or other purposes.
